## Inspiration

GoFortune is conceptually inspired by and aims to maintain compatibility with [fortune-mod](https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod),
 which was originally forked from the NetBSD version of fortune.

The [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) is inspired in the AngularJS [contribution guide](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The build process is inspired in the build process of [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser).
